      <p><h2>Hi! I'm Braden Dredge.</h2> </p>
      <p>Fun facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! Formerly a ward choir pianist, deacon's quorum president, teacher's quorum president, priest's quorum first assistant, <b>full-time missionary (Guatemala Guatemala City East, Spanish-speaking! 2017-2019)</b>, ward pianist, and elder's quorum secretary. I currently serve as a <b>ward mission leader</b>. And of course, one of the MOST IMPORTANT covenants I have ever made was the one I made with <b>my amazing and beautiful wife Kerena</b>, with whom I was sealed in the Provo City Center Temple in November 2021!</li>
        <li>I'm completing two bachelors degrees at BYU (Provo, UT) -- one in <b>Economics</b>, and another in <b>Computer Science</b>. I am also completing minors in Design Thinking and Entrepreneurship.</li>
        <li>I'm a <b>musician!</b> My work can be found on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bradendredge6809/featured">YouTube Channel</a>, or on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/braden-dredge">SoundCloud</a>. <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/braden-dredge/white-withered-rose">"White Withered Rose"</a> (vocals, guitar) is a song I wrote back when I was 2014, around the time I moved to Oregon. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/braden-dredge/suburban-seasons">"Suburban Seasons"</a> is a composition (oboe, piano, and strings) I made back in 2015, inspired by the feelings I felt about the neighborhood I moved into. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ze73erAGw">"Heavenly Father Has a Plan"</a>  was a song (vocal, piano, violin) I wrote on my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iros7y_fWr0">"Infant Holy, Infant Lowly"</a> is a piano arrangement I made for Sacrament Meeting after returning from my mission.</p></li>
        <li>I'm a total <b>math geek AND nerd</b>. I am a big fan of Numberphile and OneBlueThreeBrown videos on YouTube. I was so excited about my curvy cup measurement project back in high school calculus that I literally emailed my middle school teacher to tell him about it (I was so proud of it). This is why I chose to study two math-heavy fields, and I aspire to do lots of math in my career.</li>
        <li>You're reading the bio of a <b>spelling bee champ</b>. Yep. I participated in the California Nationwide Spelling Bee back in my prime. A bit of a grammar Nazi.</li>
        <li>I'm also a geek for <b>languages</b>. I've started about 4 different languages on Duolingo (Spanish, German, Portuguese, French), and every now and then I try to learn more from each. I also try to find Spotify playlists to listen to so that I get some more exposure.</li>

  <h2 class="subtitle">Programming</h2>
    <p><a href="https://startup.curemonolingualism.click/">This</a> is a startup I'm developing known as "Cure Monolingualism" (the namesake of this website). I got the idea of the name from Dr. Troy Cox who is a linguistics professor at the BYU Center for Language Studies.</p>
    <p><a href="https://simon.curemonolingualism.click/">This</a> is a Simon project, built especially for my CS 260 class.</p>
    <p><a href="https://prompts.curemonolingualism.click/">This</a> is for language students to prepare to take the written proficiency test (WPT).</p>

    <p>I'm a HTML/CSS/JavaScript king thanks to my CS 260 class at BYU. This list is grossly incomplete.</p>
